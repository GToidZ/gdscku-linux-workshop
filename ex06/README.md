# Unopened Box

In this task to obtain letter number six, you need to go through a cardboard box and count the items inside.

For this, we want you to use `tar` to read the archive. And refer the number of items to the `REFERENCE` file.

# `tar` - Archive Utility

To start using `tar`, you should consult its manpage (`man tar`).

Example: To extract everything,

```sh
tar -xzf box.tar.gz
```

Example: To list files,

```sh
tar -tf box.tar.gz
```

You should also know how to count lines up to now, yes?
