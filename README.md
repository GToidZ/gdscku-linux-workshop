# Meet Pingu
Pingu is a penguin from Antartica. He wants to go to the annual penguin meeting, however due to secrey of location, he'll need to figure out where the city of meeting is being held.

Here's the excerpt of the letter to Pingu:

```
Dearest friend penguin,

You have been invited by another penguin, whom is a celebrity, is throwing a party and would like you to join us.
However, due to secretive information, I decided that my location is redacted, and it is your job to discover it by yourself.
I have included instructions on how to do so at the end of letter.

Signed off,
Tux
