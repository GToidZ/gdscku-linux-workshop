# Moving In and Out

You'll need to move the directories in and out of other directories provided in `ex01`.

For example, if your directory structure is:
```
abc/
bac/
cab/
egg/
```

You need to try to order folders in order to create a phrase which can be viewed using `pwd`.

**HINT:** The first directory is `fir`.

## Moving things around

To move items around in Linux, use `mv` command.

This command will move `abc` directory into `bac` directory.
```sh
mv abc/ bac/
```

This command will move `egg` directory out by two folders.
```sh
mv egg/ ../..
```
